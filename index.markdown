I'm currently a PhD student in the Computer Science & Informatics program at Emory University. I primarily collaborate with members of the Department of Biomedical Informatics and am advised by [Dr. Matthew Reyna](https://reynalab.org/). My research focuses on developing novel computational methods to address emerging challenges in oncology research, ranging from innovative statistical approaches to identify driver genes from genomics data to exploring barriers to clinical trial enrollment using natural language processing. In addition to my research interests, I enjoy organizing community building and professional development events through my roles as a Laney Graduate School EDGE ambassador, CSI PhD program ambassador, and Woodruff Student-Alumni Committee Member.  

Prior to arriving at Emory, I graduated from Williams College in June 2021 with a BA in Biology and Computer Science. I completed a senior honors thesis, under the supervision of Dr. Claire Ting, that explored potential niche-defining genomic differences across strains of *Prochlorococcus marinus*, a prominent marine microbe. I then began a post-baccalaureate fellowship at the National Institutes of Health as a member of NICHD's Bioinformatics and Scientific Programming Core. Across the two-year fellowship, I collaborated with labs across the institute to implement bioinformatics pipelines in a range of data modalitites, including bulk/single-cell transcriptomics, proteomics, and methylation sequencing. Additionally, I actively developed some of the core's code infrastructure and created an interactive teaching tool to explain the subtleties of DESeq2, a popular library for differential expression analysis.
