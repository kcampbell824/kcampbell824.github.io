I'm currently a graduate student in the Computer Science & Informatics PhD program at Emory University, primarily hosted in the Biomedical Informatics Department. Prior to arriving at Emory, I graduated from Williams College in June 2021 with a BA in Biology and Computer Science. I completed a senior honors thesis, under the supervision of Dr. Claire Ting, that explored potential niche-defining genomic differences across strains of *Prochlorococcus marinus*, a prominent marine microbe. I then began a post-baccalaureate fellowship at the National Institutes of Health as a member of NICHD's Bioinformatics and Scientific Programming Core. Across the two-year fellowship, I collaborated with labs across the institute to implement bioinformatics pipelines in a range of data modalitites, including bulk/single-cell transcriptomics, proteomics, and methylation sequencing. Additionally, I actively developed some of the core's code infrastructure and created an interactive teaching tool to explain the subtleties of DESeq2, a popular library for differential expression analysis.
